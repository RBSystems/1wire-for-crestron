This project is designed to connect devices with 1-wire bus to the Crestron controllers without expensive gateways.The connection is made directly to the serial port of the controller using 4 diodes and 2 resistors.

Using this software in your projects you will reduce their costs and improve competitiveness.

Currently this software allows you to work with sensors DS18B20 but plan to add support of other useful devices that enhance the functionality of your projects.

Always love to hear your feedback and suggestions at crestron.ua@gmail.com.
